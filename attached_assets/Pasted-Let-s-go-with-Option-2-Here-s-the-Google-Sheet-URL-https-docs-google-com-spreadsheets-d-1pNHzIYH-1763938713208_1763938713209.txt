Let’s go with Option 2. Here’s the Google Sheet URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNHzIYH58a7zPTjexSQW6eGibYJGQYk5Yfv1pdNYdW8

CONTEXT & GOAL
You have access to the PRD “Semester Volunteer Matching System (V1.0)” and a live Google Sheet that contains all data for Learners and Learning Peers.
The front-end UI for the TutorMatchScheduler is already built.
Your task is to design and implement the backend (API + matching logic + Sheets integration) so that it fully satisfies the PRD and the additional requirements below.
Tech stack & environment
Choose the backend stack (language + framework) you are strongest with on Replit (e.g., Node/Express, Python/FastAPI, etc.).
Constraints:
It must expose HTTP REST endpoints for the existing front-end to call.
It must integrate securely with the Google Sheets API for the live data source.
Before coding, briefly state which stack you are choosing and why it fits this project.
Data source: Google Sheets (primary source of truth)
Primary data source: a single live Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNHzIYH58a7zPTjexSQW6eGibYJGQYk5Yfv1pdNYdW8
This spreadsheet contains four worksheets:
Requests
Learning Peers
Volunteer Class Schedule
Learner Class Schedule
The structure and required fields for each sheet are as follows (only use these fields in your models):
Requests: Timestamp, Email Address, First name, Last name, Which specific course would you like help in?, Who is your instructor?, Instructor Match Required?, What is your section number?
Learning Peers: Email, Preferred Name, Last Name, Groups, Course Code 1, Instructor 1, Course Code 2, Instructor 2, Course Code 3, Instructor 3, Other Courses
Volunteer Class Schedule: MRU_EMAIL, First, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY
Learner Class Schedule: same 7 fields as Volunteer Class Schedule.
Google Sheets integration & models
Implement a dedicated data access module (e.g., googleSheetsData.*) that exposes:
loadRequests()
loadLearningPeers()
loadVolunteerSchedules()
loadLearnerSchedules()
Each function should:
Use the Google Sheets API to read from the correct worksheet in the spreadsheet above.
Use credentials and spreadsheet ID stored in Replit Secrets (environment variables, not hard-coded).
Return typed objects for each row, using only the required fields listed above.
Ignore any rows where the email address = chickey@test.
Parse and clean schedule fields (MONDAY–FRIDAY) as lists of time slots like 0830-0950; 1000-1120; 1300-1420, representing times the participant cannot meet.
Parse Learning Peers.Other Courses as a list of CourseCode + Instructor combinations, stripping letter grades like (A), (A-), (B+), etc.
Data cleaning & instructor normalization
Trim whitespace from all strings.
Implement a normalization / grouping function for instructor names per course code, e.g.:
For a given course code, treat Marina Elliot, Marina Elliott, and Dr. Elliott as the same instructor cluster.
Treat clearly different names (e.g., Professor Emeritus John Robertson) as separate instructors even for the same course code.
The field Instructor Match Required? is either 'Y' or blank. If 'Y', the Learner must only be grouped with other Learners and a Learning Peer with the same instructor for that course.
Matching logic & constraints (from PRD – treat as hard rules)
Implement the matching algorithm as described in PRD section 4.2 (hard constraints and optimization priorities).
Refined PRD Based on Refined Pr…
Hard constraints include at minimum:
Group size: 1–4 Learners per group, all in the same course code.
Volunteer load: ≤2 groups total per Learning Peer.
Availability window: 1-hour session between 08:00 and 20:00.
Travel buffer: at least 5 minutes before and after any class for all participants.
Instructor match: if Instructor Match Required = 'Y', the Learner’s instructor must match the Peer’s instructor, and all group Learners must share that instructor.
Optimization priorities:
Priority 1 (hard): maximize the total number of matched Learners.
Priority 2 (soft): where multiple options exist, prefer time slots within ~2 hours before or after existing classes for on-campus convenience.
API endpoints
Implement REST endpoints consistent with the PRD user stories, including:
POST /api/matching-runs: ingest live data from Google Sheets, run the algorithm, store and return a summary (run ID, counts, timestamp).
GET /api/matching-runs/:id/groups: return all proposed groups (group info + Peer + Learners + 1-hour slot).
POST /api/groups/:id/approve: finalize a group and trigger a notification function that (for now) simulates sending a single email to all participants with the details.
POST /api/groups/:id/reject: reject and re-queue participants for future runs.
GET /api/unmatched: list unmatched Learners and Peers with constraint failure reasons, plus suggested alternative time/group when failure is due to a single constraint.
Authentication (build last)
The PRD includes secure Admin login (US-001), but implement this after the core backend, matching, and Google Sheets integration are working.
Until then, allow unauthenticated access to the Admin endpoints to simplify development, but structure routing so authentication middleware can be added later.
Development process
 Before writing code:
Summarize your understanding of the data model, Google Sheets integration, constraints, and endpoints.
Propose a file/module structure and indicate which stack you will use.
 Then implement in small, testable steps: data access → schedule parsing → matching algorithm → API endpoints → finally, Admin authentication.
